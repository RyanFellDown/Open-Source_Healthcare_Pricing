# Open-Source_Healthcare_Pricing
Utilizing publicly available medical datasets, I'm creating an API that finds average billings and patient pricings per Zip Code depending on procedure done. My hope is to expand this into an interactable map that allows patients to move through it, similar to Google Maps, and discover pricings at different locations near them based on procedure done.
