#   This file is to check if the codes from the JSON file with the mapping (codes --> description)
#   are all present in the codes from the CMS database (and vice versa).
#
#   If any codes are missing, we need to add them, and if there are any in the JSOn file
#   that aren't in the database, then we can get rid of it.
